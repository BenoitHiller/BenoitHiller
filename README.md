## About Me

* I wrote a [http server in bash](https://github.com/BenoitHiller/shellby/blob/master/lib/http.sh) at one point. Let me know if you can think of a good way to get chunked encoding to work as the fun part is being able to connect it to pipes, but chunked encoding requies handling strings with `\0`...
* I do too much coding in at work to feel motivated towards the early 2010s goal of producing meaningful contributions to *software* in my free time these days but will help you with yours.
* Genuinely eager to hear criticism of my work. A big part of being able to learn and improve is making sure that I can always see many flaws in myself and my code to chip away at. I would love your help.

## Dear Recruiters

If you would like a response to your emails please include the following string in them: `29a4b4bb-30d2-432d-bacc-c7386da87477`. Though I doubt I'm going to bother going through the interview process for a company that is building some vague technical novelty in the hopes of eventual usefulness or a minor convenience that hopes to make profit through rent seeking after creating a monopoly.
