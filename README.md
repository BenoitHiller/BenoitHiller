## About Me

The projects here are now fairly old examples of my work. The most interesting thing I have to say about them is probably to talk about some of the thought behind [shellby](https://github.com/BenoitHiller/shellby) that continues to inform my approach to this day.

Shellby is an IRC bot written in bash (with a little help from awk and sed which are programming languages in their own right).
The motivation for building it was that at the time I had discovered some enormous, inscrutable bash scripts in production at work and pondered the question:
> Are there things I can do to write large bash programs that are substantially more maintainable or if not what are the specific flaws in the language that make that impossible.

The answer was of course somewhere between those extremes, but the time invested learning bash with that focus has paid off many times over.

In general the insights I've gained from studying programming languages that make dramatic tradeoffs, like bash does, have taught me a lot of things that can be used in all programming languages.
This is especially true now that we are creating fewer new popular programming languages and instead we see the existing ones slowly copying useful features from each other as if all converging towards an optimal featureset.
